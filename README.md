Why this project?
-----------------

This project is a free clone of the main modpack of a french minecraft server called [Paladium](https://paladium-pvp.fr/).
This server was created by the french youtuber FuzeIII and is the biggest french pvp-faction.

Informations
------------

This project use the free voxel game engine [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) with the [MineClone2](https://git.minetest.land/MineClone2/MineClone2) subgame.

This modpack is very WIP and breaking changes can be made with  no warning. Use at your own risk until the main features of the modpack will become stable.

This project is mostly a personal project, but I will accept pr for translation, bugfix and better textures.
