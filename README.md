A free clone of the main modpack of the french minecraft pvp-faction server [Paladium](https://paladium-pvp.fr/).

For the free voxel game engine Minetest with the MineClone2 subgame.

This modpack is very WIP, use at your own risk.

Breaking changes will be added with NO warning.

This project is mostly a personal project, but I will accept pr for translation, bugfix and better textures.

Installing
----------

No external mods are required, but I suggest you to use mcl_build_limit by @AFCMS.
